  <h2>Apps to Edit</h2>
  <p>
    Click on one of these links to enable Lexicon editing on that app. When you click on a link below,
    you will see Edit Content buttons around parts of your app. These buttons open the editor and
    allow you to change text. Editing is enabled as long as your browser is open. If you want to edit
    later, you will have to sign-in at this Lexicon Server again.
